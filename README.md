# War_on_Map
It is a OOP-based game. I want to program a game as well as practice my new knowledge on OOP and STL

# Main object
1. I want to create a set of object in real world wars, countries, people, products and landscape, and put
them into a virtual war game.

# Design
1.Some continuing updating doc in folder "/doc" show the design, requirements and occurred problems

# Code
1.Now that the initial code is quite simple, "/src" is a fine container.

# Test
1. I want to separate the test data with the core data at the first step.
