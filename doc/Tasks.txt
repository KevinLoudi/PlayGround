#Task 4: Formating console output

#Problem 1: the use of consant
 You can't initialize a non-const reference from a const reference, 
 because doing so would defeat the purpose of having a const reference in the first place.
 
#Problem 2: request for member 'GetInfo' in 'cd', which is of non-class type
 Formal: 	City cd();
			cd.GetInfo();
 
 Corrected : 	City cd;
				cd.GetInfo();
				
#Problem 3: 'friend' used outside of class
Remove the friend in the .cpp file. It is only required (and allowed) within the class definition
 in the header file.
 
#Problem 4: invoke function with ostream &
 use cout as input para
 
#Problem 5: cannot modify static variables in construct and de.
 initialize it explictly
